# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 20
###### Fri, Oct 12th, 2017

It was really amazing to have our projects be done and over with, and I was really impressed with so many of the projects that I saw from our class. It is really amazing how much we improved in three weeks.

I was kind of appalled with the JS401 presentation though. Not because they did badly or anything, the project seemed like it was cool (I think? I didn't really follow very well...) and I know they did a lot of complicated things on the back end, but no front end at all!? It surely couldn't have taken that long for one person to code a simple front end for presentation purposes... It makes me really think that I'm a front end person and I won't like back end programming.

After class a lot of class bonding and alcohol was had, and I slept in until 1PM on Saturday which was amazing. Finished up the rest of my coursework for 201 now! Over the next week, I plan to get my mortgage license reinstated for part-time work so I can try to make some money while going to classes, I plan to read that additional JavaScript book that Sam recommended at the end of class, do some Code Wars katas, and start on making my own improvements on our 201 project (in a different repo of course). I want to adopt it as my own project for my spare time. Will update on how that all went in my next (301) journal entry!
