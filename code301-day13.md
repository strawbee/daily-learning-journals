# Code 301, Day 13
###### Wed, Nov 8th, 2017

Nicholas and I stayed until 10PM last night finishing our lab for the day (that was way too much to cram into one day's lab, and I usually finish things ahead of time) and getting started on today's lab. I'm moving in to Code Fellows, which is great, because I can cancel my mortgage. The couches are pretty comfy and my new gym is near by.

Today we decided to stop working at 11AM and spend a good long time at the gym and then lunch, so that was really good. Ran for 6 miles! Gonna try to go for 7 tomorrow to round out a whole hour. We're going to Beer&&Code tonight for our required meetup for the class so maybe we can get a head start on tomorrow's lab (or at least finish today's... we're almost there. And we need to spend at least an hour discussing some really important planning details i.e. outfits for tomorrow. If there's anything I learned from the 201 project, it's that more planning is better).

Overall, weeks 2 and 3 have been extremely frustrating. I don't like being the guinea pigs for a new curriculum, and I don't know if the previous curriculum was any better, but I'm not impressed with this one and it was frustrating when we were told that we've learned more already by the start of week 3 than any 301 had learned before. I feel like we needed to start smaller, learn to crawl before jogging. The previous 301s graduated students who successfully then graduated from 401, so... maybe we don't need to cram more info than ever before into the course and focus on just learning fewer things but learning them really well. I always prefer depth of knowledge to breadth.

But who knows, maybe I will ultimately benefit from this and it's just the experience itself that's really frustrating.

Edit: Okay but now that Sam has actually shown us what the previous 301s worked on, I don't feel like we actually learned any more than they did, so maybe I'm just frustrated because last week was sort of confusing and overwhelming and I thought it'd be like all reinforcing the concepts and review this week, but yesterday was really overwhelming too and we had way too much to do for lab. Today's lab was better though and it doesn't look like the rest of the week will be too bad.
