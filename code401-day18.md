# Code 401, Day 18
###### Wed, Feb 7, 2018

Still going! I fell a bit behind over the weekend and have been continuously a lab behind this week. I'm not too concerned because I will have this weekend to catch up and I do want to get started on project planning before the weekend.

Project group is meeting tomorrow to decide on a final idea. I wish we had gotten more input for the ideas that we turned in. I want to work on a meaningful or awesome project but still pretty unsure what we're doing... Fingers crossed for tomorrow.

Sad that we're missing hash maps day on Friday. Hope that we will be able to take a break during the career day to see the other 401 JS class' final presentations on Friday as well.
