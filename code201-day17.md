# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 17
###### Tue, Oct 10th, 2017

We have another learning journal two days in a row!? Haha... not much to say that I didn't say already in the day 2 project check up assignment. A lot of grinding today, a fair amount of spending a lot of time on fixing little details (that are still important). I think that I do tend to think everything is easier than it will be, and my team member Seth tends to think everything is harder than it will be, so there's a happy medium somewhere in between.

I left my house at 7:30AM today to arrive before 9AM, then left Code Fellows at 7:30PM and arrived around 8:15... then spent another few hours trying to fix code at home, so that was a lot of coding. Didn't get to do my Tuesday run, which sucks... coding school is going to make me soft. :) But luckily project week is an outlier.

For the amount of time I spent on things, I feel like I should have gotten much more done, but I did iron out a few annoying small details at least.

Tomorrow we have a lot to get done and I actually need to leave by six, since I have martial arts from 7-8, and dance teams from 8-11... not enough time in the day for anything!
