# Code 301, Day 19
###### Thu, Nov 17th, 2017

We finished final touches on our project by like 6PM. This project was so chill. There were challenges but I don't think we ever felt like we weren't going to make any deadlines. We got a lot of stretch goals done, and the ones we didn't get one (incorporating a travel API) were super stretch goals anyway. The code is a bit messy and could be cleaned, but everything is functional so I'm okay with that. I'm liking my layout and think we did a great job with the project. Cheers.
