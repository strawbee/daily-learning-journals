# Learning Journal: Code 301, Day 5
###### Fri, Oct 27, 2017

I have a decent concept on this week's concepts. I don't really foresee myself using Handlebars in my own projects but maybe I'll change my mind and warm to it. Maybe not.

I do like jQuery a lot and I took Khan Academy's jQuery course to get more familiar with it. I think there's a lot of potential for learning and doing cool things down that path.

I've been partnered with Joe and Garrett for lab yesterday as well as today since Dustin didn't have time to assign partners yesterday, but I think it was a good group. Joe knows more than I do on a lot of topics which is the first time I've experienced that in a pair programming situation. It's really intriguing to see how his mind navigates the assignments as well as a bit frustrating if he's moving too fast and trying to go forward before I'm on the same page, which is enlightening to my interactions with others in my groups. It's what inspired me to take the jQuery course in Khan Academy - seeing someone in action who already knew jQuery with seeming ease and familiarity.

Tried skimming the AJAX chapter in the JS book (totally thought that was due on Monday, and I do think that if assignments are due, they should be posted in Canvas under the day of) but really couldn't concentrate and it's such a foreign concept, I'm going to have to go over it slowly over the weekend. A bit apprehensive about next week's topics because all of the syllabus is completely foreign to me, but I think if I take some time to do my readings carefully it will be fine.

Have not been getting nearly enough sleep this week. Looking forward to Zzz's.
