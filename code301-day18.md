# Code 301, Day 18
###### Mon, Nov 15th, 2017

We hit MVP on our project early in the morning and spent the rest of the day testing, deploying, fixing bugs, and working on stretch goals. I also did a lot of CSS, finished the mobile layout, and created the layout for non-mobile sites, and it looks pretty good if I say so myself. :)

Progress is coming along more slowly but I think we'll have a really solid product in the end. Lots of goals to hit tomorrow and it's 2AM and I'm still working on the project. I really need to stop staying up so late!
