# Learning Journal: Code 301, Day 6
###### Mon, Oct 30, 2017

I think today is the first lecture where I tried to pay attention the whole time, and I still didn't get the majority of the concepts. Usually, I just do the readings and then I can multitask during lecture, and I still feel like I have a good grasp of what we're learning. These big-picture, back-end concepts are crazy and confusing. This must be what people felt like in the middle of 201.

Things I only have a nebulous concept of:
* Servers
* MVC
* API
* Ajax
* Ajax with JSON
* Ajax with HTML vs Ajax with JSON
* HTTP
* REST

Amazingly, we covered almost all of these things this afternoon, haha. Anyway, before my head explodes, I'm going to go focus on really important things like what I'm going to wear for Halloween tomorrow.
