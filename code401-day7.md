# Code 401, Day 7
###### Tue, Jan 13, 2018

Almost halfway through week 2. Week one went well. So far 401 is a lot slower than weeks 2-3 of 301. I think a lot of people were stressed out by the amount of homework over the weekend, but my group figured out Bitmap transforms very quickly and then delegated the rest of the tasks so the weekend went smoothly for us. A couple of the labs took me about 4 hours, like linked lists (the reverse function was tripping me up for a good amount of time) and TCP chat was just such a new concept. Actually, everything on the syllabus for the next few weeks except the data structures are all concepts I know little to nothing about.

But I am finding time to still have a life and to be able to do other things concurrently with 401, which is awesome. Still averaging about 4 hours of sleep a night, but completely my own fault because I just stay up watching movies or going out dancing. :) I like to think that I can function better than the average person on little sleep, though.

I should get back into doing Codewars problems.
