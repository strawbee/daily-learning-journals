# Code 301, Day 11
###### Mon, Nov 6th, 201

Didn't get to do nearly as much as I wanted to programming-wise over the weekend! It was a dance intensive weekend but now ready to get back to coding. Partnered with Nicholas C this week - best team ever. We spent like 2 hours deciding our team name (FUBAR-at-theFooBar) and coordinating our outfits for the week instead of strategizing for our actual code, so you know it will be great.

Lab from this weekend was rough! I started it around midnight Sunday night, stared aimlessly at the code for an hour, and then cried to my husband about how much I suck at programming. When I actually wrote the code this morning, I finished it pretty quickly because all the To Dos were very specific, but didn't feel like I had a good grasp of the overall picture. Will be good to reinforce the concepts this week~
