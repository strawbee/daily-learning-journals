# Code 401, Day 13
###### Wed, Jan 31, 2018

The latter half of week 2 and going into week 3 is now starting to feel more challenging like weeks 2 and 3 of 301. I have to say everything from the latter half of last week is pretty hazy, and I'm extra glad we're using Express again and not writing the HTTP servers vanilla style. Excited to be thinking about project week already although there is still a lot to learn until we can do what we want to do. 

Other than in class stuff, I coded a random group generator with AngularJS @ https://strawbee.github.io/groups/. Dustin already uses another random generator but I got my first real practice with Angular so I'm happy. I love how fast Angular is and would love to make larger SPAs with it, as well as to compare it with React. I guess Code Fellows used to teach Angular and switched to React, so there must be a good reason, although I see a lot of job postings asking for developers experienced in the MEAN stack.

Also got to 4kyu ranking in JavaScript in Code Wars and ranked #22 in the CF clan. Fun times. I think it'll be harder to level up now because I still like doing the 5kyu problems a lot more than the 4kyu ones, which take forever.
