# Code 301, Day 19
###### Thu, Nov 17th, 2017

Good day Friday - great projects from the whole class, my team's presentation went well, and then lots of well-deserved celebrating with classmates. I feel like the whole group has bonded so it'll be sad to part ways with most people for 401. I have a good bit until the January 401. Lots of real life things to catch up on, including getting up to date on my dance choreo, going to martial arts more, and running my half-marathon next weekend. I've been falling behind! Oh yeah, and my house is a disaster. My hubs doesn't clean so someone should... maybe.... maybe not me x) I mean I read an article at some point that people are happier when they spend money distributing tasks that they don't want to do while spending their own time being productive on what they do want to do or are good at, so.

Anyway, after the half marathon, there's a wedding that I need to make and also a week with family in January, and MIL coming to town for another week. And maybe do a couple mortgage loans for spending money/tuition. But, I should still have time and here's my study plan:

* One Code Wars a day
* Pick a personal project to work on. I haven't decided what, yet, but now that we've completed the 301 project, I feel like I could do a lot more. I think it would be really cool to start with a 2 person game that users can play on their cell phones, now that I know how to persist data through databases. Then, maybe move to a multiplayer game akin to jackbox.tv.
* Hang out with my 301 classmates that are taking the Nov 27 401 course and check out what they're learning so that I won't be totally raw going into 401. I mean, I'd hang out with them just to hang out, too. They're pretty cool. :)

Will check in on Jan 15th or so to update on how all that panned out~
