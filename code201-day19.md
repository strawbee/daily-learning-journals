# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 19
###### Thu, Oct 11th, 2017

Our project is complete! YAY. We didn't get to do user testing because we were working on getting it completed all day, but my husband likes it...

We finalized details and fixed the last bugs, and programmed the code output today. It feels really good to have a final product.

I can't believe tomorrow is our last day of Code 201. I'm excited to see everyone else's projects. I haven't been able to see what anyone else has been up to, either, because we've had so much work to do! This week has been a lot of grinding on the project, so I didn't get to research new topics, but I did get a lot of practice in while grinding. I think I will sleep a lot this weekend and then it's on to more learning and 301 prep :)
