# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 8
###### Wed, Sept 27, 2017

I'm tired. We worked on the sales page of our cookie stand project today and added in the ability to add/modify (the modify part is a stretch goal) the data. The lab took a really long time compared to how long I usually take, and I'm not sure that I utilized the most efficient method. I did manage to get the lab and stretch goal done though, and I can easily add in the ability to delete a store too with the way that I structured my code. I think the labs and actually writing code is the best way to learn code, although sometimes I wonder if I can even understand my code and am in awe of how I accomplished it, after I finish a lab/project.

The events chapter that was due for reading this morning was really dense. I may have to re-read it at some point to fully understand it, but I think I can get by for now.

I finished the HTML and CSS For the index.html page of our Cookie Stand project yesterday, so I don't think I will have much to do tomorrow for it, since Sam said we will be mostly focusing on CSS and design later on this week.

I wonder what we will be focusing on in week 3. jQuery, I'm assuming, since that's pretty much all that's left in our books to read about.

Not too much to say today. I'm still caught up on the class syllabus although this is a lot of work and material to cover.
