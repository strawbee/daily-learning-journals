# Learning Journal: Code 301, Day 1
###### Mon, Oct 23, 2017

It hardly seems like any time has passed since 201 ended! Over the break, I caught up on sleep (lots and lots of sleep) and on socialization.

Code-wise, I read the first four chapters and did the exercises in the Eloquent JS book, read the 5th chapter and didn't really understand it, and attempted a problem for like 2 hours and flipped some tables (figuratively). I'm sure I'll get there, but I'll leave all the higher level functions to contemplate on later since we have so much to do starting today! I also messed around with my 201 project in a different repo and improved on it a bit. I also did some Code Wars katas (I'm ranked somewhere in the 80s in the clan, now... haha). Other than that, I just did the pre-work since the week was so short.

301 is a lot more work intensive than 201. I like that, except for the part where it looks like I will actually be here from 9AM to 6PM every single day. In 201, I was able to finish almost all of my labs early and go home early. But I think any extra time can be well used to study the topics and learn new ones. It's also a lot more partner work, which will be an enlightening experience throughout I'm sure!

Browsing through the 301 topics, I'm really nervous about week 2 because I have no idea what any of those words mean. But I think by the time week 2 rolls around, I will feel fine about them (hopefully). Once, I was really nervous about jQuery, but I feel like with some practice I can totally get a handle on it now.

I really love katas, but the 4 and 5 kyu ones are really giving me difficulty. Excited to improve more so that I can do them with ease.
