# Code 301, Day 17
###### Mon, Nov 14th, 2017

Okay, we got so much done today! We're almost at MVP. I think we can hit it tomorrow morning and start working on stretch goals tomorrow afternoon. I wrote (with other team members intermittently navigating) pretty much all of the AJAX calls and server-side code today. I wasn't that confident in my back-end skills but apparently I do know a lot because I cranked out all that code, so I'm really proud of myself. :) And Will created a good compilation of airports in a .JSON file today, and Andrew and Joel made progress on the maps. Fingers crossed for MVP tomorrow morning - we have a lot of stretch goals!
