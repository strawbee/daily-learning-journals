# Learning Journal: Code 301, Day 3
###### Wed, Oct 25, 2017

So far 301 is going well, although I made the bad decision of dropping molly and going to the Q nightclub yesterday so I was not feeling very well all morning. Oh well, live and learn - not doing that again! P.S., totally kidding about the drugs and nightclub (Brandy just loves telling us not to do that at the beginning of every course), but did have a late night. The lab still went well, though.

The lecture topics are actually covering things not in the readings at times, so I've gotta keep in mind that I need to focus more during lectures.

I really like Code Wars. Got to under rank #50 in the Code Fellows clan and am ranked 5 kyu, yeah~ And I completed my first 4 kyu kata today. I try to avoid the katas that have complicated math concepts, though, because I am just not a math person. I want us to start getting assigned more than 7-8 kyu Code Wars problems in class.
