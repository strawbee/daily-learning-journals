# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 11
###### Mon, Oct 2nd, 2017

Spent the weekend mostly catching up on sleep, so not much new to say! There was a lot of sleep to catch up on.

In class, we learned a bit about video and audio. I don't think I will implement it too much, but good to know! Started a new lab project in class today. I think that with the exception of my getting stuck on not being able to get a function to recognize the event object, which Allie solved, it went smoothly. (Apparently, if you try to call two functions with one event listener, but the event object is being used in the second function, things go haywire.) I was able to solve what was required in a logical way and without getting stuck.

Over the weekend, I did start reading a bit about jQuery, and it will be nice to be able to use that instead of all of the DOM appending. jQuery is much shorter. Looking forward to learning more of it.
