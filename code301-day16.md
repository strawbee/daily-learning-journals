# Code 301, Day 16
###### Mon, Nov 13th, 2017

Got started on project week. We are doing a weather API. We got Google Maps on the page pretty easily and starting to get some styling done. Front end seems fairy straightforward - what we're having trouble on is deciding on the API (finally settled on Wunderground) and whether to populate the response by airports or cities (decided on airports), how to translate the weather to airports, what number of airports/cities is enough (decided on fewer is better to start out with), and how to not exceed the number of calls per minute to our API (10 max). We need to get data for each airport for each month and populate that into our table. Each airport per month would constitute one call.

Getting on it~
