# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 16
###### Mon, Oct 9th, 2017

On Friday we got together with our teams, and since my project idea was the most fleshed out, my team agreed to go with it. Yay. :) We made our group agreement, project plan including domain model, and did some general planning.

Today, we got together and finished the planning, wrote user stories, pitched our project idea, and started coding. We got the HTML framework done, then each started our own CSS files. I mostly finished mine during class hours, then put in a couple more hours at home. I think I'm pretty much done with it now.

Over the weekend, I did quite a few Code Wars katas. It was really exhilarating when I was able to solve a problem, but then also really humbling seeing the most voted for solutions and how much they were better than mine, or how they used code that I couldn't even read. I did look some recurring concepts up, and now I now about the array methods .forEach(), .filter(), .map(), and .reduce(), as well as a rudimentary knowledge about the arrow function (=>). On my list of things to research is let, const, and regular expressions. I've done the readings in our book about regular expressions, but I feel like I haven't even begun to break the mold. The way that people are using regular expressions is totally mind boggling and they are definitely not very readable or discernable without prior knowledge, so I just need to study them in depth when I have the time.

I am doing so much coding and learning about coding in my free time without being prompted to do so, which is amazing and awesome since I'm doing it because I enjoy it. I can't say that I've felt that way about 95% of classes I took in college or law school. :) I've read and taken notes extensively on CSS including all the new CSS3 features, on JavaScript concepts that we haven't learned in class yet, jQuery, etc... I feel like I came into 201 with a better understanding of HTML and CSS than most (but that knowledge was really, really rusty and at least 10 years outdated - although it was easier for me to relearn due to prior experience) and the same (zero) knowledge of JavaScript, but I've done so much more of my own research that I am maintaining a knowledge gap between most people in the class. Even still, I feel like I can still delve into everything that we've covered more in depth and there isn't enough time to solidify everything that I want to.
