# Code 301, Day 10
###### Sat, Nov 4th, 201

This week introduced a lot of new concepts. I'm glad I'm taking December off because I can really solidify some of these concepts over the break. Also glad that we will be writing our own code next week, because even if I take the time to understand someone else's code, I will not know it as well as if I wrote it myself. 

I have over 10 hours of dance practice this weekend so peace.
