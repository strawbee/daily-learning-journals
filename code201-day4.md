# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 4
###### Thu, Sept 21, 2017

Today we did code review of the 6th and 7th questions in our About Me projects. Sam wrote out an example of how each question would work. It was interesting to see how it differed from mine. He used for loops to find if an answer matched any of the values in the array, and I used indexOf. During the morning lecture, I was also reading about Regular Expressions, and I think something like the following would work too, although I haven't tested it:

>var answer = RegExp(answer);
if (answer.text(arrayOfPossibleAnswers) === true) {
  alert('You are right!');
} else {
  alert('You are wrong!'); }

(Not sure why I can't get this markdown code to have line breaks!)

Yesterday I was reading about JavaScript bitwise and I have no friggin' clue what it was talking about. Not even a little bit. Do JavaScript programmers actually have to learn bitwise? Because I might just go back to the mortgage industry, haha. I did look up how to convert numbers to binary and now half-assedly know it, although I gave up after I looked up how to convert letters to binary.

We did pair programming for the first time today. My partner was Dre. It was a good exercise to explain my code to him, and we also worked on making his code work. As the navigator, it was a bit slow because I kept asking him to put line breaks or spaces and stylistic preferences in my code. We finished the basic lab requirements via pair programming, but I did the stretch goals on my project as the driver while Dre navigated. It took me longer than I would have liked to write one function for questions 1-5 with a for loop, but speed will come with practice.

I'm happy with my progress so far. I'm not feeling freaked out or out of my league in class as everything we are learning was covered in the readings, and I retain readings well. The only thing that is a bit daunting is the breadth of learning there still is to accomplish, even just on the front end. I've barely begun to scratch the surface of JavaScript or CSS. I was browsing code for the featured layouts in CSS Zen Garden and there are so many terms that I don't know. I am interested to learn BootStrap and responsive design in general, as well as jQuery, the CSS spinoffs (I don't even know what SASS, etc. are supposed to do), etc. Even though I am absorbing a whole ton of new info and concepts, there is still a long, long, long way to go.
