# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 13
###### Wed, Oct 4th, 2017

Mid-week! This coding boot camp is really turning my sleep schedule around. I went from sleeping at 2AM or later to sleeping at or before midnight by this week. I kept at around 2AM on weeks 1 and 2 and it was exhausting, but now I am officially an old person with my sleeping schedule. Hooray! ..?

We delved into ChartJS yesterday. It was a bit frustrating for me because the coding is very counter-intuitive, but the charts are pretty.

Local storage today. I managed to figure out local storage from Googling it yesterday and got the functionality of today's lab done, yesterday. But, I switched things around and did some stretch goals during lab today. I really like the concept of local storage and it clicks with me.

Starting to think about team projects, but it really depends on what team I have and what their strengths and ideas are. I think I will tend to want to do everything myself, so I will need to control that impulse and be a good team player. I'm going to not hold any expectations about the team project until my team actually meets.
