# Code 401, Day 26
###### Mon, Feb 19, 2018

Project week went well! I'm really proud of the work accomplished. I went into the midterm project being really uninspired and unexcited about what we were doing, but after changing the project idea on Monday and  getting into the code, I loved it. I felt so productive and I really think we need a project once in a while to reinforce the concepts we learned in class. I was behind all of week 3 and not too confident about week 2, but during Thurs of project week I wrote all of the back end auth and mongoDB code myself. Everything that we learned really came together. I also had a ton of fun writing the game logic, solving problems regarding how to do things (night and day intervals, integrating the TCP with HTTP servers, separating chat rooms in the TCP chat, etc...) and making everything flow together. So yeah, booyah. Now I just have to think of something truly awesome for the final project because that's the one we really need to impress on.

Happy to be doing front end again. I actually feel inspired to do the readings ahead of time. I _want_ to learn about React and to know how to do everything in it, and I can't say I felt the same about the back end readings. From the readings I've done on React so far, it's pretty counterintuitive. Angular seems faster to pick up, but I don't doubt that React will be more scalable once I get past the steeper learning curve.

I'm really sad that we're skipping socketIO. I feel like our class is behind compared to the previous 401 class - we have 2 full days dedicated to trees and hash maps, but those were on schedule to be covered in the first half of class. I'm not sure what else we'll be missing, but two of the three final projects from the previous 401 utilized socketIO as their main component, so it seems like a big loss to be skipping it. I also feel like we are behind on data structures and would love to focus more on that. That's probably one of the most important things we will be learning, since it will definitely come up and be a main part of our interviews. I would love to have optional data structure questions posted each day because that's something I would like to improve and focus on.
