# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 18
###### Wed, Oct 10th, 2017

Had to skip martial arts today because I left the campus too late, went straight to dance from 8-11PM, and after I got home I started to do some DRY coding to our JavaScript, and what do you know, it's 2:30AM. Project week kinda sucks because I don't have time to wash my hair (thank god for dry shampoo) and what even is sleep anymore? But otherwise, it's cool. :)

We consolidated our code today and got everything functioning except the output. Lots to do tomorrow (today?) but it seems manageable, as long as we have a good plan for the day and I don't fall asleep.

That is all.
