# Code 301, Day 15
###### Fri, Nov 10th, 2017

What a long week. Parts of it was really rough, but I had a great partnership which really helped. As far as debugging and analyzing my own reactions, it was a learning experience. I think it's applicable when Sam said that this is the first week (slash couple of weeks) where I really struggled with the material, since learning everything on the front end came very easily to me, and I didn't even understand the concept of what the back end meant before last week. Even though when I look back on it I don't think I struggled more than anyone else, the fact that it was new to me made it seem much more of an ordeal.

I think project will be okay! I have a pretty solid team. Fingers crossed that all goes smoothly next week.
