# Code 401, Day 38
###### Wed, Feb 28, 2018

Really happy that we are tying front end and back end together now. Our labs are becoming more interesting, although still plenty frustrating with tons of debugging. Front end tests are not fun.

I have a solid finals group, stoked about that. I'm going to go into finals a lot more excited than going into midterms - can't wait. We need to nail down a really good idea.

A bit of a motivation slump, so I'm constantly a day or two behind on my labs, but I think everyone else is too, so I'm not too worried about it. Can't believe there's only 1.5 weeks of 401 left before project week! That's insane. What a trip.
