# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 6
###### Mon, Sept 25, 2017

Over the weekend I looked up how to responsive design, and it is *SO COOL*. I now understand the basic HTML and CSS behind responsive design, as well as how grid-based templates work via CSS/HTML. I also looked up responsive design frameworks. Bootstrap had been the only one that I had heard of before, and I understand that it is by far the most popular. Many of the sites that I look up coding from have Bootstrap tutorials. But, after some research, I think I will embark on my responsive design journey using Pure. I haven't had a chance to try it out yet, but it is simpler and smaller in size compared to Bootstrap. I like the idea of a minimalist framework where I do most of the customization.

I also did a quick review on my HTML and CSS and read the course JavaScript book up to the end of Chapter 5. I had planned to read a lot more of the book (had planned to finish the week's assignments, if not the whole book) but did not get to it because Chapter 5 ended up being a lot more dense than I thought it would be, and it looks like the next chapters will be just as dense. The readings are now taking me longer because we are moving into territory that was not covered in the pre-work, so I am learning it for the first time instead of reviewing the content. I think I am starting to understand the basics of the Document Object Model. For some reason, tutorials in the pre-work always mentioned it but never sufficiently went into detail explaining what it was.

There's still a lot of JavaScript and CSS that I am aiming to learn, and I also want to go through problems and solve them, because that really helps to hammer in the concepts learned, but I'm finding that there just isn't enough time in the day to do everything I want to do regarding coding as well as my other life commitments and hobbies. I'm starting to think 10 days between Code Fellows courses isn't enough for both reviewing and solidifying everything learned in the previous course and getting a good grasp of the pre-work for the upcoming one, not to mention resting a bit!
