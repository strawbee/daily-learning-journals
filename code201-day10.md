# Learning Journal: Code 201, Day 10
###### Fri, Sept 29, 2017

Two weeks down! Even though it's overwhelming thinking of how much there still is to learn (it seems like I find something else that I didn't know about, or am interested in knowing about, every single day that requires learning an entire new program or language / parts of languages), it's heartening to know that we've only had 2 weeks of class. It's amazing how much we've accomplished in just two weeks. It feels like I've been going to boot camp much longer. I'm feeling pretty decent about everything we are learning in class. 

I've browsed through quite a few developer web sites and while I was at first really impressed with the responsive, full width, scrolling layouts, it started to seem like almost every developer has almost the exact same layout (similar to what I made for the index page of my cookie stand lab). I think before, 10 years ago or so, the layouts were less "new age" and less UI friendly, non-responsive, etc.... but, they were more varied. When you browsed people's websites, you saw fixed width layouts with frames, tables, divs, and many different styles. I feel like everything new in front end web development is becoming more homogenized and I'm not sure if I like that. I will need to really brainstorm to make my portfolio page stand out when I create one.

The ones I saw that did stand out stood out on such a crazy level that it's almost panic-inducing to think how long it would take me to learn coding and image manipulation to that extent. Here are my three favorite portfolio sites that I browsed:

* Denise Chandler [http://www.denisechandler.com/] - Damn, that is some artistic skills. I'm not going to aim to do something like that because I want to focus on learning coding and not photoshop, etc. but this definitely stands out and you can tell she spent an awesome amount of effort on her site. Oh, hey, the main heading says Stand Out too. She definitely does.

* Clement Zezuka [http://www.czk.fr/] - I found out this effect that he does with the scrolling is called parallax, which is something new that you can do with CSS3. That's amazing. I am going to learn this. Another thing to add to my list of what I still need to learn...!

* Jack Jeznach [https://jacekjeznach.com/skills/] - Another amazing site that really stands out. I'm hoping we will learn some of how crazy animations next week when we do CSS animations. That's something that I'll need to learn and explore more in depth too.

Never enough time in the day. :)
