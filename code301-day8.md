# Learning Journal: Code 301, Day 8
###### Wed, Nov 1, 2017

I think I understand what a server is. Yay!

Still don't know what API, HTTP, REST, and some other things are though.

As far as the code portion goes, I'm totally cool with that. I can write out code and I can learn code. What I'm not familiar with, I can get more familiar with practice.  As far as explaining the higher end concepts, I'm noping on that, but baby steps; I'm just happy I know what a server is now.

I really like SQL. It seems like a really simple language compared to JS.

And I think it's really cool that we're creating paths in our server.js that are actually URLs that people (well, eventually - right now, just us) can access. Really ties in the front end and the server file.

301 is totally messing with my running schedule though. In 201, when I finished my labs early, I was leaving the school around 3-4PM every day and could make it to the gym before my other evening activities. Now, I've been finishing my labs around 10:30 each day but I take a 3.5 hour lunch instead, and by the time I'm done with dance or martial arts after Code Fellows, I'm too wiped to run! I think maybe I should join a gym around Belltown with a treadmill so I can run during lunch hour, because my performance is way suffering and I'm really concerned about my half marathon at the end of the month. :(
